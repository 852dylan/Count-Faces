# Count Faces 

## Requirements:
  - Python
  - OpenCV: ML image and video library
  - Dlib: Pre-trained ML model 

<p>Fully functional program that takes video input and uses the pre trained Dlib ML algorithm to count and trace boxes around faces in frame. This is my first successful ML project and I am very happy with how it turned out.</p> 
<p>Also worked on git and markdown skills.</p>
